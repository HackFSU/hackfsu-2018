HackFSU Hackathon Management System - API & Website
===================================================
# About
## Main Features
* Multi-hackathon management
    * Can use the same system every hackathon
    * Can view statistics of current and past hackathons
* User accounts for all attendees: Hackers, Judges, Organizers, and Mentors
    * Users can be different types of attendees every hackathon
    * Users can use the same account for different hackathons
    * Users can be combinations of different attendees for the same hackathon (Although hackers may only be hackers)
        * Mentors can be Judges, Judges can be Organizers, etc.
* Hacker registration & management
* Automated mentor system built on simple, easy to submit, help requests
* Judging system to help make the judging process smoother, faster, more fair, and more accurate.
    * Takes the logistical hassle out of the judging process, allowing for every judges to judge more hacks and thus teams seen by more judges.
    * Partial Devpost integration to allow hacks to be submitted and shared using hacker's DevPost accounts
* Organizers can manage the all different
* Admins can manage high-level site settings without changing any code

## Technical Overview
* Single API to allow support the website and iOS/Android apps
* Back-end written in Python with the battle-tested, comprehensive Django framework
    * Simple, uses well-established standards, and organized into different components
    * Django models make databases easy
    * Django has integrated sessions and user authentication
* Front-end compiled from modern templating languages and served using Django views
    * Using Gulp, the complicated, time-consuming compiling is done only once before the Django server boots
        * Allows for complex builds involving many organized files to decrease development and debugging time
        * Django mostly just serves static files with minor changes
    * Custom project configuration is friendly to new developers
        * Can have a revolving team so that the site can be maintained after people graduate/leave


# Contributing
## Development Requirements
### Running front-end demo
* nodejs 6.x

Run the demo. Does not access real server, just a mock express one.
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run demo
```


### Running full server
* a copy of `./hackfsu_com/secret_keys.json` (get from someone)
* python, python-dev
* python3.5, python3.5-dev
* pip3.5
* virtualenv
* nodejs 6.x

Setup virtualenv (do once)
```bash
$ virtualenv -p /path/to/python3.5 /path/to/repo/venv
```

Update virtualenv (do every time requirements changes)
```bash
$ ./venv/bin/pip3.5 install -r requirements.txt
```

Build frontend with npm
```bash
$ npm intall
$ npm run build
```

Run server in virtualenv
```bash
$ ./venv/bin/python manage.py runserver 8000

```

Make these tasks easier by using PyCharm and setting up run commands.


# Server deployment
Push an update to live, then run a deploy. Server access required.

The deploy script makes updating the server easy. This assumes it has already
been setup on the server. See Jared for server setup guide.
```
$ git push origin master
$ git push origin master:live
$ ssh hackfsu.com
[hackfsu]$ sudo /root/deploy.sh
```

# Access Control List (ACL)
The ACL is what determines whether or not the website page or api path is accessible by a user. Once a user is logged in they gain access to different restricted pages based upon the different groups their account belongs to. In addition, accounts may be disabled which will prevent them from being logged in with but not deleting them.

* When a user cannot access a website page, they are redirected to `/user/login?accessDenied=true&path=<originalPath>`
    * If the user is already logged in, they are just redirected to `/user/profile?accessDenied=true`
* When a user cannot access an API path, the call will return a `401 Unauthorized` error in the standard API error format.

All registrations of any type must be approved/activated by an organizer or admin. Admins may only be created manually by other admins. Users may belong to more than one ACL group. For example, an organizer may also be an admin, mentor, and judge.

## ACL Groups:
* `user` - anyone logged in with an account. Has UserInfo object in db.
* `hacker` - users registered as a hacker for the current hackathon. Has HackerInfo object in db.
* `mentor` - users registered as a mentor for the current hackathon. Has MentorInfo object in db. Can answer help requests.
* `judge` - users registered as a judge for the current hackathon. Has JudgeInfo object in db. Hackers may not register as a judge for the same hackathon. Can judge hack submissions.
* `organizer` - users registered as an organizer for the current hackathon. General organizational tasks allowed such as viewing users, checking people in, and sending updates. Cannot be a hacker for the same hackathon.
* `admin` - users set as an admin by other admins. They have access to hackathon management and django administration. Cannot also be a hacker for the same hackathon. This is the same as being a django superuser, and is not a user group but a set flag.

## ACL Examples:
* [] => unrestricted
* [!user] => cannot be logged in at all.
* [user] => must be logged in and belong to the user group (any logged in user should belong to this group)
* [user,!hacker] => must be logged in and belong to the user group but not the hacker group
* [mentor] => must be logged in and belong to the mentor group.
* [admin] => must be logged in and have the admin flag set.
* [admin,mentor] => must be logged in and have either the admin flag set or belong to the mentor group.


# Website Informal SRS
Most of the pages are dynamic in nature, and rely on the API which is specified in the next section. Redirects are in the form `<MATCHING_ACL> -> <DESTINATiON>`.

## Shortcuts
There are some simple redirect paths for ease of use, specified below. The ACL of the destination page will be used for determining access, although the redirect itself is unrestricted.
* `/register` -> `/registration/user`
* `/signup` -> `/registration/user`
* `/hack` -> `/registration/hacker`
* `/mentor` -> `/registration/mentor`
* `/judge` -> `/registration/judge`

    - Judging works through a series of rounds until every hack has been seen at least 3 times or an organizer has stopped the judging.
    - To receive a new round a judge must go to the organizer table and ask to be assigned one.
    - At the end of all judging (as determined by the organizers), the top 10 or so of the hacks (based on overall score) will be released. The final winners will be determined manually by the final judges during the closing ceremony.

# Project Structure
This project basic structure is that of a Django project, but it does not exactly follow all the 'Django' ways of doing things. The project is split up into two main sections, the API and the webapp.

## API
The API is the main powerhouse of any backend service call, including the managment of all the data modules. The Django Webapp, iOS app, and Android app all use this same API for accessing and managing the application data.

## Webapp
The webapp serves the front-end templates. Page content is dynamically populated via AJAX calls to the API.

If you take a look into the `/webapp/` folder you will see many different types of files. If you are unfamiliar with ANY of these technologies, please learn them via their respective documentation BEFORE working on this website. You can ask someone for help if you are having trouble, though it is recommended that you read through their docs a bit first. They docs are pretty good, and the tools are fairly simple once you get the hang of them.

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files, `*.scss`, are used to create Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files. We use this because Sass is an awesome tool that allows for nesting, variables, math, importing other sass files, and much more.
    * In addition to Sass, we use the [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) tool in our build step so you don't have to worry that much about browser incompatibilities
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org) (formally known as Jade) files, `*.pug`, are used to create Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) files. We use these as HTML template files so that we can make pages that are consistent, easy to write, and easy to read. We make extensive use of pug variables, extension, and blocks in order to abstract out most of the repetitive tasks required when adding/editing new pages, which allows us to focus on just the page content. This is a custom setup that has been found effective.
    * **Note** Django does indeed have its [own templating system](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/templates/#the-django-template-language), which is actually still being used. There is a pug engine that we could replace it with to have it compile entirely in django, but it does not have all the necessary support as its main JavaScript compiler. However, we can still allow the backend view to modify the HTML by writing unbuffered django templating language constructs directly in the pug files (just be careful).
* Python files, `*.py`, are the backend files used to serve the templated HTML files. These will be pretty small in most cases, and you should not touch these unless you are changing the backend.

The `webapp/views` folder acts as a base for all views and corresponds to different URL paths. For example `/index.pug` is the pug template for path `/` and `/registration/hacker/index.pug` is the pug template for path `/registration/hacker/`.

For each path, the `index.pug`, `script.js`, and `style.scss` files are all kept in the same directory to keep things simple. Keeping page-specific source files in one place is better than separating them by file type (like `/js/views/registration/hacker/script.js` and `/css/views/registration/hacker/style.js`) because with many views there just gets to be so many mirrored directories, breeding errors and annoyances. With a sophisticated front-end builder like Gulp, we can automatically place the generated JS, CSS, and HTML files where they need to go but still keep the like-minded source files together.

### Building
The `.scss`, `.js`, and `.pug` built using Gulp, a very handy task runner. Gulp has been setup in this project to adhere to the following rules:
* `.scss` files will be compiled, then auto-prefixed to `.css` files into the build folder to be accessed as static files (like `/static/view/registration/hacker/style.css`)
* `.js` files will be [uglified](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/) and copied into the build folder to be accessed as static files (like `/static/view/registration/hacker/script.js`)
* `.pug` files will be compiled to `.html` files into the build folder to be accessed as Django template files (like `registration/hacker/index.html`)
* Files or folders starting with an underscore (`_`) will not be built by Gulp. This is particularly useful for pug/sass files that are just used to compile other pug/sass files by their respective compilers.

The JS/CSS files must be accessed by the HTML pages using absolute paths from the Django static folder, `/static/`. If your page is 404'ing on a static resource be sure to check if the path is correct and that it was actually built (if it needed to)

Files located in the `/static/` project folder are not compiled and can be accessed as-is. Use this for images and other non-compiled files.

# TODO
* Page alerts
    - Backend can trigger the creation of alerts that appear at the top of the page, and are dismissable
    - Use the Bootstrap alert classes
    - Should be very simply to add to any page
    - Could be session-based and appended automatically?
        - May need to set up a pending alerts model
    - Could be dynamically added instead
* ACL enforcement
    - Should be done with a custom view class
* Add Django template support functions to Pug
    - Should be as minimal as possible as to keep it as pug-like as possible
    - Something like `django('some_var')` should compile down to `{{ some_var }}`
    - If/else construct support would be nice as well
    - Might be able to just put in raw, unbuffered text as an option too
